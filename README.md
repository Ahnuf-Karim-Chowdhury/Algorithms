## Algorithms

### BFS Algorithm
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root node and explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

### DFS Algorithm
Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Topological Sort Algorithm
Topological sorting of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge `uv` from vertex `u` to vertex `v`, `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.

### Dijkstra Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm
The Bellman-Ford algorithm computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.

### Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights.

### Johnson's Algorithm
Johnson's algorithm is a way to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a sparse, weighted, directed graph.

### Prim's Algorithm
Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.

### Kruskal's Algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm that finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest.

### Knapsack Algorithm
The Knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

### Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM) Algorithm
The Matrix Chain Multiplication problem is a classic example of dynamic programming. The problem is to find the most efficient way to multiply a given sequence of matrices.

### Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Algorithm
The Longest Common Subsequence problem is to find the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences.

### N-Queens Algorithm
The N-Queens problem is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

### Sum of Subsets Algorithm
The Sum of Subsets problem is to find all subsets of a given set that sum to a given value.

### Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) Algorithm
The Travelling Salesman Problem is a classic algorithmic problem in the fields of computer science and operations research. It focuses on optimization. In this problem, a salesman is given a list of cities and must determine the shortest route that allows him to visit each city exactly once and return to his original location.

### Trie Algorithm
A Trie is a special type of tree used to store associative data structures. A common application of a Trie is storing a predictive text or autocomplete dictionary.

### Binary Search Algorithm
Binary Search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.

### Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt string searching algorithm searches for occurrences of a "word" W within a main "text string" S by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match could begin.

### A* Algorithm
A* is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal. It is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm that has a heuristic to guide the search.

### Kadane's Algorithm
Kadane's algorithm is used to find the maximum sum subarray in a given array of integers.

### Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable where the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.

### Minimax Algorithm
The Minimax algorithm is a decision rule for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin"—to maximize the minimum gain.
